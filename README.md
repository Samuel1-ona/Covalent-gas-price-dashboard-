# COVALENT GAS PRICE DASHBOARD MADE POSSIBLE WITH COVALENT UNIFIED API KEY

## Details

The creation of this Single-Page Application (SPA) was a contribution to the Covalent bounty initiative named "Build and Deploy a Chain-specific Gas Price Dashboard Using GoldRush Kit." This application empowers users by enabling them to input their Covalent API key, select a blockchain, and pick from diverse event types. Through this platform, users gain access to dynamically displayed gas prices correlated to the chosen event type within their selected blockchain. This interactive feature significantly enriches user interaction, offering insightful perspectives into gas prices associated with distinct activities on specific blockchains.

## Deliverables
- Front-end code of the SPA using existing GoldRush components and ones you build.
- Deployment of the application on a hosting platform like Vercel.
- User input sections for the Covalent API key, chain selection, and event type.
- A display area showing real-time 1, 3, and 5-minute average gas prices related to the selected chain and event type.
- Use https://ui.shadcn.com/ and https://www.tremor.so/ to render data, similar to how GoldRush Kit does now.
- Documentation detailing the use of the page and steps to obtain an API key.
- A statement or best practice guide on the secure usage and non-retention of the user's API key.
